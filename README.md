This lab focuses on building a structured HTML5 webpage while ensuring proper validation. I created a semantically structured webpage using HTML5 elements, implemented a contact form with built-in validation, validated the HTML code using the W3C Validator, and published the project on GitHub. The lab helps reinforce best practices in HTML5 structure, form validation, and version control. It was about writing valid semantic HTML5 code, using HTML5 forms with built-in validation, checking and fixing errors using W3C Validator and finally publishing it on GitHub using version control.
